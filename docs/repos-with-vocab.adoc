These github repos of mine have German vocabulary:

* link:https://github.com/kurt-krueckeberg/501-verbs[501-verbs] has the PDF of the verbs in **501 German Verbs**. I think I also have a PDF.
* link:https://github.com/kurt-krueckeberg/Germ201[Germ201] has all my completed assignments from BYU's German 201, and it has each chapter's cirriculum (including probably its vocabulary).
