# Issues

Code currently goes into an infinite loop during `build_html()`. 

Test each of theese: DBWord, DBVerb and DBNoun

These all use DBWordBase and how it and its parent classes are designed needs to be reviewed.

* Finish the database-insertion code with various input words like kommen, gehen, etc, that have prefix versions \
  also test with nouns and other parts of speech like adjectives and adverbs.
