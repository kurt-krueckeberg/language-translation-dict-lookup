Possible Bug:

It seems that translated text with a special character like an apostrophe is not escaped before database insertion.

That Vocab code is confusing: it inserts words into the database: `insert_db(array $words)` and then
returns an array of words that either were already in the database plus those that weren't and got inserted.

It seems the word that gets inserted is not always identical to the word in "words.txt". I think a word like, say,
'liest' may be found as 'lesen', which is what would get inserted. 

Solution: 

1. Change the code to emit a message that "word 'liest' not in dictionary, but 'lesen' was found".
2. Don't save the word to the database.

foreach ($words as $word)

$resultIter = $db->fetch_db_word($word);

// Fetch db words, defns, exprs, and samples, and create html output
foreach ($resultIter as $result) {

   //...
   $word_id =$result->get_word_id();
   //...

   $sampleIter = $db->fetch_db_samples($word_id);

}
