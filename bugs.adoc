# Bugs

Surround both the insert into db of words and insertion of samples with one commit and rollback.

New code under development is in ~/temp:

* If Leipzig can't find any sample sentences for a word, say, 'sich äußern', it will return a 404 "not found" error. 

* If SystranTranslator::lookup() can't find a definition for a word, what does it return?

* What happens if AzureTranslate::translator() can't translate a string? What exception does it throw?
