# Bugs

Surround both insert_db($word) and insert_samples($word) with the same commit/rollback

New code under development is in ~/temp:

1. If Leipzig can't find any sample sentences for a word, say, 'sich äußern', it will return a 404 "not found" error.  

2. If SystranTranslator::lookup() can't find a definition for a word, what does it return?

3. What happens if AzureTranslate::translator() can't translate a string? What exception does it throw?


Changes:

Changed RestApi.php to enable setting http_errors in ctor.

#1 is now handled above for the case where no samples are found.

#2 may be handles as the code correctly detects the case of "no definitions".

#3 What I expected for this case is happening. I am getting:

* A Status code of 429
* The associated message is: "The server rejected the request because the client has exceeded request limits."
