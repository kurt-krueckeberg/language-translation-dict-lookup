# Bugs

* If Leipzig can't find any sample sentences for a word, say, 'sich äußernä, it will return a 404 "not found" error. 

We could surround the sample sentence request with a check for 404, and translate that into an error message nad simply continue.

* If SystranTranslator::lookup() can't find a definition for a word, it, too, returns a 4xxx error--correct?

* What about AzureTranslate::translator() exceptions?

OR; 

I could use http_eroors = false and simply check for the particular reason codes. If Leipzip returns 20, I know there are no samples sentences. If
SystrnaTranslator::lookup returns 400, this means--correct?--that there are no definitions....

...and if AzureTranslatoe::translate() returns -- what? -- thios means what?
