Vocab should fetch the samples and check if we can translate them or if we have exceeded our hourly limit.

I am implemnting this.

If I lookup a past participle, like begaben, it will return results for the infinitive, begeben. The word_looked() up will be different than the
results returned, which are for the 'lemma' in `$matches['source']['lemma']`.

Maybe we need the 'lemma' instead? Which will be a non-reflexive and non-prefix-verb form: it will be a sinlge word, and the shortest such verb.

Try writing sample code that would look up:

1. prefix verbs like: ankommen, ansehen.
2. verbs with prefix versions: kommen, sehen
3. past particles: kam, sahen
